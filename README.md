# NLP-Question-duplicates

This project explores Siamese networks applied to natural language processing to find if two questions are duplicates or not. The project uses Trax deep learning library for implementation.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Following packages should be installed on python 3:

- Trax
- numpy
- random

<a href="https://github.com/google/trax" target="_blank">Trax</a> is an end-to-end library for deep learning that focuses on clear code and speed. It is actively used and maintained in the Google Brain team. It is faster than Tensorflow and Pytorch and also the codes are more clear. It also supprts both TPUs and GPUs.




## Dataset

The model is trained and validated on 10K tweets. I used 8K tweets for training and 2K tweets for validation.
